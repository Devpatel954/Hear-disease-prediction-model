# Heart Disease Prediction Model 💓

This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction Model** built using a Logistic Regression algorithm. The model predicts the risk of heart disease based on various patient attributes. The prediction interface is deployed as a web application using **Streamlit**.

## 📝 Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease using various health metrics. The model was trained using a dataset of patient records and is served through an interactive Streamlit web app.

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive web app interface using Streamlit
- Real-time predictions based on user inputs
- Logistic Regression model for heart disease classification
- Easy-to-use interface with inputs like age, sex, chest pain type, and more

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data processing
- **Scikit-learn** for training the Logistic Regression model
- **Streamlit** for creating the web interface
- **Pickle** for saving and loading the trained model

## 📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a heart disease dataset (`heart_disease_data.csv`). The dataset includes the following features:
- **Age**
- **Sex**
- **Chest Pain Type**
- **Resting Blood Pressure**
- **Serum Cholesterol**
- **Fasting Blood Sugar**
- **Resting ECG Results**
- **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved**
- **Exercise-Induced Angina**
- **ST Depression**
- **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment**
- **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy**
- **Thalassemia**
- **Target** (0 = No heart disease, 1 = Heart disease)
